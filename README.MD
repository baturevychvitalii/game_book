make temporary_build.sh executable and execute it.
or simply copy paste it's contents into terminal.
later will switch to Make.
If you decide to make normal Makefile - don't use CMake. I'm using this project
at university, and we are allowed to use only pure make
src/main.cpp now is an example of application of src/graphics/* library
I'll open this project when i pass my semestral work (9.6.2019)
